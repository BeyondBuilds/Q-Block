### **1. Blockchain Core Development**  
**Language**:  
- **C++**: Bitcoin Core is primarily written in C++, so sticking with it allows you to reuse most of the existing infrastructure while modifying it for quantum encryption.  
- **Rust** (Optional): For more security and memory safety, you could implement critical cryptographic components in Rust and call them from C++.

**Frameworks & Libraries**:  
- **Bitcoin Core**: The base code for your blockchain.  
- **Open Quantum Safe (OQS)**: A post-quantum cryptography library that provides CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Kyber, and other quantum-safe algorithms.  
- **Boost C++ Libraries**: Widely used by Bitcoin Core for threading, data structures, etc.

---

### **2. Wallet Development**  
**Languages**:  
- **Python**: Easier to work with for wallet and key generation, and integrates well with cryptographic libraries.  
- **JavaScript (Node.js)**: Ideal for building web-based wallets and user interfaces. It can also handle signing and broadcasting transactions.

**Frameworks**:  
- **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) with Python Bindings**: For post-quantum cryptography in the wallet.  
- **Flask** (for Python) or **Express.js** (for Node.js): For building lightweight, secure APIs for the wallet.

### **3. Web Interface (Blockchain Explorer & Wallet UI)**  
**Languages**:  
- **JavaScript / TypeScript**: Highly recommended for building web interfaces due to flexibility and ease of use.  
- **HTML/CSS**: For basic UI structure and styling.

**Frameworks**:  
- **React.js**: For building the blockchain explorer and wallet UI. It’s fast, scalable, and allows for easy state management.  
- **Next.js**: If you need server-side rendering for better performance.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: For quick, responsive, and modern UI design.

---

### **4. Consensus and Networking**  
No changes are required here unless you modify Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work. If you do, you may want to use:  
- **Go** or **Rust**: For building scalable, secure networking and consensus modules.

---

### **5. Smart Contracts (Optional)**  
If you plan to add smart contracts:  
- **Solidity**: If using Ethereum-like smart contracts.  
- **Rust**: If building contracts on WASM-compatible platforms like Substrate.

---

### **6. DevOps & Deployment**  
For deploying and managing nodes and wallets:  
- **Docker**: To package the blockchain node and wallet for easy setup and testing.  
- **Kubernetes**: For scalable testnet or mainnet deployment.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated testing and deployment.

---

### **7. Testing & Security Audits**  
- **PyTest**: For unit testing wallet and cryptography code.  
- **GTest**: Google’s C++ testing framework for blockchain core tests.  
- **OWASP ZAP**: For penetration testing web interfaces.  
- **Wireshark**: For analyzing network traffic to ensure it’s quantum-safe.

---

### **Summary of Suggested Stack**  
- **Core Blockchain**: C++, Rust (optional for security-critical parts)  
- **Cryptography**: Open Quantum Safe (OQS) library  
- **Wallet**: Python (Flask/Express.js)  
- **UI**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js  
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions  
- **Testing**: GTest, PyTest, OWASP ZAP
